## Animation `>` _type_ & color

<Notes>but we are not giving the importance it requires</Notes>

---

### Animations are `not` the icing in the cake

We need to plan them from the beginning

---

<Notes>When we start a project, we create wireframes to communicate composition</Notes>

<Notes>
  and we have gone as far as having tools that even generate code for the styles of a
  design
</Notes>

# Basic terminology

### Communication is key

<Notes>
We need a way to be able to express the way we want an animation to work.

Saying "I want this button to disappear after clicked" is like telling
someone to make a menu pretty or a button important, it is really ambiguous

</Notes>

## Transition

#### Our building block

<Notes>A transition is our main tool to create animations.</Notes>

---

### An animation can be made of `one` or `more` transitions

<Notes>
Transition is not equal to animation, an animation can be made from just one transition but it could also be a group of transitions.

Imagine that animation is a living being

There are organisms and it can be made of only one cell or have a lot of cells.

And if a transition is a cell, then it is made of many parts...

<Notes>... but don't worry there are less parts in a transition than in a cell</Notes>

---

## A transition is made of...

- Start state
- End state
- Time
- Delay
- Easing

<Notes>I'll explain them but first let's loos at an example</Notes>

<Notes>let's break it down into it's elements</Notes>

## Easing

### The style of your transition

---

## An `easing` is technically

### a function that defines the `progress` of the transition through `time`

### Motion Specs

```
start state
  - x:0
  - y:0
  - scale:1

end state
  - x:300
  - y:300
  - scale:2
time: 3
delay: 2
ease: EaseIn
```
