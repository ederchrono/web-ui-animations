## Why animation is important?

<Notes>
  We are used to things moving, in nature there are no static things (animals, clouds,
  even plants move) We can't perceive as static things that don't really move like
  buildings, because we are affected by our own motion.

### Animations communicate

<Notes>
  if an image is worth thousands of words, imagine how many words is an animation

  I think all of us have seen something like this in the preferences of any website that
  requires you to login. Sometimes we give it a chance and check it, but most of the times
  we uncheck it and never come back.

  Now this toggle control has the same functionality that the previous one, but this one
  rewards you when you activate it. Somehow it gives you the feeling that they appreciate
  that you accept to be in their mailing list. And if you deactivate it, you might even
  regret it (it looks so sad).

<Notes>
  Not even a heavy typography or the color red got your eye as much as that moving button.
  The grey color in the animated button might even make it look like it is disabled, but
  that doesn't matter because it is moving and our brain tells us that we should put
  attention to it
